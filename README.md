# CarsDekho Data Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the **CarsDekho dataset** using **SQL** to uncover insights about used car listings, pricing trends, fuel types, ownership patterns, and seller behavior.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate **SQL querying, data cleaning, and analytical skills** by working with a real-world automobile dataset.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Database:** MySQL
* **Language:** SQL
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains information related to used cars listed on CarsDekho, including:

* Car name and brand
* Year of manufacture
* Selling price
* Fuel type
* Transmission type
* Number of owners
* Mileage and engine details

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The following data preprocessing steps were performed using SQL:

* Removing duplicate records
* Handling missing and null values
* Standardizing column names
* Converting data types where necessary
* Filtering irrelevant or inconsistent data

These steps ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key business and analytical questions addressed:

* What is the average selling price of cars by brand?
* How does car price vary with year of manufacture?
* Comparison of prices based on fuel type and transmission
* Impact of ownership count on selling price
* Identification of high-value and budget-friendly cars

SQL concepts used:

* `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
* Aggregate functions (`AVG`, `SUM`, `COUNT`)
* `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
* Subqueries

## 📈 Key Insights

* Newer cars tend to have higher resale value
* Diesel cars generally have higher average prices than petrol cars
* First-owner cars command better prices
* Certain brands consistently maintain higher resale value
